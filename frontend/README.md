# Subscan Frontend

Next.js frontend for the Subscan platform. The app will consume the FastAPI backend.

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Pages (planned)

- `/import` – Lite: upload .eml / .mbox / .csv
- `/dashboard` – card/month summary
- `/subscriptions` – detected subscriptions list
- `/upgrade` – Pro upsell + connection setup

This directory currently contains only the package manifest; run `npx create-next-app@latest` if you prefer to scaffold a full Next.js project.
